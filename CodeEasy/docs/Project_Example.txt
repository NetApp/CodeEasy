QTREE vs UNIX directories
   It appears possible to perform a "volume create -volume <vol> -junction_path <path>"
   which includes directories which don't yet exist.  Example: the users
   directories like "cptmorgan" are automatically visible when creating the
   FlexClone when the junction_path is provided.  

   After creating a FlexClone using the junction_path, System Manager will
   show the project directory "project_A" as a qtree.  
   System_Manager -> SVM -> "vserver" -> Storage -> Namespace  then click down
   thru the path.
