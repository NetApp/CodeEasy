CodeEasy_1.0.1-Alpha  (release date: 2015-03-31)
----------------------------------------
    Second release after initial customer and internal testing.
    - Added documentation associated with seting cDOT admin permissions.
      Login username/password is associated with the vserver and requires ontapi
      application access permissions to be set for the APIs used by the CodeEasy
      scripts to access the filer.
    - Cleaned up unused variables in the CEInit.pm file. Also restructured the
      file to put the most important variables for creating the initial Snapshot
      and FlexClone first. Setup for creating a volume is placed later with
      additional text since most of the time the user will start with an existing
      volume.  Some variables were renamed to improve easy of use.
    - Add check for cDOT - if a 7-mode system is detected the script will
      generate an ERROR and will exit.
    - Fixed missing exit on mkdir in CeCreateFlexClone.pl.  If the junction path
      does not have a corresponding UNIX path, then the script should FAIL with an
      ERROR before attempting to create the FlexClone.
    - CeFlexClone.pl changes
	Added -ls option to show list of available snapshots.
	Added -fc_volname option to allow flexclone volume name to be different than 
	      the junction_path volume name seen by the user.  
	      NOT WORKING IN THIS RELEASE
