- CodeEasy Toolkit - README
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Support
----------------------------------------
The CodeEasy/FlexClone for DevOps Toolkit is provided as an example of
how to use NetApp Snapshots and FlexClones to quickly create developer
workspaces.  This Toolkit is an example of how to get started - it is
not intended to be a robust fully featured flow.

It is expected that customers will use the flow to learn how to use the NetApp
Manageability SDK to automate the creation of Volumes, Snapshots and
FlexClones.  Every customer environment will have unique requirements - so it
is expected that each customer will create and support thier own custom implementation.

Support is available for this kit, with the understanding that this is an
example/reference flow and not a robust one size fits all solution.  This kit
is NOT formally supported thru the standard NetApp support system.

Compatability Requirements
----------------------------------------
cDOT
    cDOT is a requirement for the current CodeEasy implementation. The code
    assumes the use of junction_paths and vservers which are not available in
    7-mode.

    cDOT version 8.1 or later should work fine.  Development testing was done on
    a cDOT 8.3.x.

Manageability-SDK
    The 5.4 version of the NetApp Manageability-SDK release notes say the following;

    - To use the Data ONTAP management APIs, storage systems should be running Data ONTAP 6.3 or later.
    - OS Requirements
         Red Hat Linux (32-bit and 64-bit): V5, V6
         Oracle Enterprise Linux: 4.0, 4.8, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
         SUSE Linux (32-bit and 64-bit): 10.0, 11.0
    - Perl 5.8, 5.10, and 5.16

    NOTE: development testing was done using;
      Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.4 (Santiago)
      Perl v5.8.8


NetApp Manageability SDK 5.3 - ONTAP 8.3 API Documentation
----------------------------------------
Documentation associated with the cDOT command you pass thru the SDK API
    http://community.netapp.com/t5/Software-Development-Kit-SDK-and-API-Discussions/NetApp-Manageability-SDK-5-3-ONTAP-8-3-API-Documentation/td-p/97533 

Example: 
    # create clone from parent volume
    #   my $out = $naserver->invoke("volume-clone-create", "parent-snapshot", $snapshot, 
    #                                                      "parent-volume",   $volume, 
    #                                                      "volume",          $clone_name,
    #                                                      "junction-path",   $junction_path

The above API doc link will provide all the options for things like the
junction-path, parent-volume, etc.
